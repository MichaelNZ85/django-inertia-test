# Django / Inertia / Vite / Vue

This is a boilerplate project for a Django backend serving a Vue frontend using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) and Vite. 

Inertia is like "glue" that joins your frontend and backend together. With Inertia, you can serve Vue components right from your backend! (Inertia also works with React and Svelte).

The Inertia website currently only mentions Laravel and React, but they did create [a package for Django](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-django), which is what this project uses.
